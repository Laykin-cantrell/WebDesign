<h1>Attack on Titan</h1>

<h2>A Manga Series by Hajime Isayama</h2>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<P>Attack on Titan is a manga series that stands out because of its intense storytelling, emotional characters, and dark atmosphere. 
  The story follows humanity as they fight massive creatures called Titans while living behind three massive walls to protect them from the outside world. As the series progresses, it becomes increasingly complex as it explores themes of freedom, war, and morality.</P>

<h3>Chapter 1: To You, 2,000 Years From Now</h3>
  <p>The first chapter introduces the world in the walls and shows Eren Yeager's frustration with living a restricted life, along with his friends Armin Arlert and Mikasa Ackerman.
  Their peaceful life was suddenly shattered when the Colossal Titan appeared, kicking the Shiganshina District outer wall in and letting in all of the Titans. Not long after, another titan appeared, called the Armored Titan, and breached Wall Maria. Dozens of regular titans began invading the city, causing panic, death, and destruction. 
  This chapter sets the tone of the series by showing how quickly safety can disappear.</p>

<h3>Chapter 2: That Day</h3>
  <p>In the second chapter, the chaos continues as soldiers try to evacuate civilians and fight back against the titans. Eren and Mikasa race back to their house to find Eren's mother's legs trapped underneath a boulder. Trying to get her unstuck, a soldier named Hannes comes by and tries to help the kids, but then a titan makes its way towards them.
  Eren's mother tells Hanness her legs are broken and to leave her there and take the kids to safety. Hannes listens and grabs the kids. As Eren is screaming and watching his mom, he sees her get grabbed by the titan and is eaten. This moment marks a major emotional turning point for Eren and deepens his hatred toward the Titans. </p>

<h3>Chapter 3: Night of the Disbanding Ceremony</h3>  
  <p>In the third chapter, it takes place after the fall of Wall Maria and shows the refugees of Wall Maria and the Shiganshina District flee to the next inner wall, Wall Rose. As they got older, Eren, Armin, and Mikasa joined the 104th Cadets military training. After completing the training, they can choose one of the three branches to which they will be assigned.
  The first branch is the Garrison, which reinforces the walls by protecting all of the towns. The second branch is the Survey Corps, prepared to sacrifice their lives outside of the walls by defying the Titans in their own domain. The third branch is the Military Police Brigade, which exercises control over the King's subjects and maintains order.
  Eren, Armin, and Mikasa joined the Survey Corps, along with other people from their military training. The day after their ceremony, Eren and his group are stationed on top of the Trost Wall to keep guard against any Titans. Eren enjoys a peaceful day for the first time in five years since the Colossus Titan's attack. 
  That feeling didn't last long, as the Colossus Titan appeared out of nowhere near Eren's group, knocking them off the wall. They were able to recover using their ODM gear. With the Colossus Titan breaching another district Wall, Eren vows he will wipe out all of the Titans.</p>
  
<h3>Chapter 4: First Battle</h3>
  <p>In the fourth chapter, the Colossus Titan appears after not being seen in five years, breaching another wall. Using his ODM gear, Eren climbs on the titan's arm, but realizes that the Colossus Titan is intentionally aiming for the canons and vulnerable district gate instead of normally attacking at random. He believes this titan possesses intelligence unlike that of the others.
  After learning in military training, he goes for the back of the titan's neck since it's the weak spot for killing a titan. As he's going for the neck, the Colossus Titan suddenly emits a burning gas from its body, which causes Eren to fly off the titan. As the smoke clears, the titan has already disappeared into thin air, leaving nothing but smoke and two large footprints, just like it did five years ago.
  Eren and his comrades are in a panicked state, but members of the Garrison branch show up and tell the trainees who came in contact with the Colossus Titan to report back to headquarters. The city is once again in a panic. </p>
