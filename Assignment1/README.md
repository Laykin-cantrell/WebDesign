# Attack on Titan

## A Manga Series by Hajime Isayama

Attack on Titan is a manga series that stands out because of its intense storytelling, emotional characters, and dark atmosphere. The story follows humanity as they fight massive creatures called Titans while living behind three massive walls to protect them from the outside world. As the series progresses, it becomes increasingly complex as it explores themes of freedom, war, and morality. What I enjoy about it is the incredible character development, the storyline, the beautiful soundtrack, and how it sorta relates to our own history of wars.
